This project performs sentiment analysis on text reviews using machine learning techniques. It classifies text into three categories: "bad", "good", and "neutral" based on their sentiment.


Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This project demonstrates how to build a sentiment analysis model using Python, scikit-learn, and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). The model uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier trained on TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors and sentiment scores from VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner).

Features
Preprocessing text data (removing stopwords, tokenization).
TF-IDF vectorization with n-grams for feature extraction.
Sentiment analysis using VADER for sentiment scores.
Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment classification.
Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Fghjjjjjjk/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
Install dependencies:

Ensure you have Python installed. Install required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk
Additionally, download NLTK resources:

bash
Copy code
python -m nltk.downloader punkt stopwords vader_lexicon
Dataset:

Replace reviews.csv with your own dataset file containing text reviews and sentiment labels ("bad", "good", "neutral").

Run the script:

Execute the Python script to train and evaluate the sentiment analysis model:

bash
Copy code
python sentiment_analysis.py
Usage
Modify the script to suit your specific dataset and requirements:

Replace reviews.csv with your own dataset file.
Adjust parameters (max_features, ngram_range) in TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction.
Explore alternative machine learning models or feature engineering techniques.
Files Included
